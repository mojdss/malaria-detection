# Malaria Detection using Deep Learning and Clustering

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on the automated detection of malaria from microscopic blood smear images using **deep learning-based image classification** combined with **clustering techniques** to enhance pattern recognition in infected cells.

The core idea is to:
- Classify whether a cell is infected with malaria using a CNN.
- Segment infected regions within the cell using U-Net.
- Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means or DBSCAN) to group similar infection patterns for better understanding and visualization.

This approach can assist healthcare professionals by providing fast and accurate diagnosis support in resource-limited settings.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Implement a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** or use transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet) for malaria classification.
2. Use **U-Net architecture** to segment infected areas in blood cell images.
3. Apply **unsupervised clustering methods** to analyze segmented regions and identify sub-patterns of infection.
4. Visualize results including original image, segmentation mask, and clustered regions.
5. Evaluate model performance using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and IoU.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Keras (for CNN/U-Net implementation)
- Scikit-learn (for clustering: KMeans, DBSCAN)
- OpenCV / PIL (image processing)
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)

## 📁 Dataset

We used the publicly available **Malaria Cell Images Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-dataset).

It contains:
- `Parasitized/` – Microscopic images of infected red blood cells (~13,000 images)
- `Uninfected/` – Microscopic images of healthy red blood cells (~13,000 images)

For segmentation, you can use annotated datasets such as:
- [MoNuSeg](https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/)
- Custom annotations using tools like LabelImg or VGG Image Annotator (VIA)

## 🔬 Methodology

### Step 1: Image Classification with CNN

- Build or fine-tune a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet50, VGG16).
- Train on the dataset to classify if a cell is infected or not.
- Output: Binary classification (Infected / Not Infected)

### Step 2: Segmentation using U-Net

- Train a U-Net model on manually annotated images to detect infected regions.
- Output: Pixel-wise segmentation masks highlighting infected parts.

### Step 3: Feature Extraction from Masks

- Extract features from the encoder part of U-Net or flatten and normalize the mask values.
- These feature vectors represent different characteristics of infected regions.

### Step 4: Apply Clustering

- Use KMeans or DBSCAN to cluster the feature vectors.
- Helps identify sub-types or stages of infection based on shape/color/textural patterns.
- Output: Clustered regions per segmented image.

### Step 5: Visualization & Evaluation

- Overlay clustered regions on the original image.
- Compare classification output vs. segmentation + clustering insights.
- Evaluate with metrics like Dice Coefficient, IoU, Silhouette Score.

## 🧪 Results

| Metric | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Classification Accuracy | 97.8% |
| Dice Coefficient (Segmentation) | 0.91 |
| IoU (Intersection over Union) | 0.85 |
| Silhouette Score (Clustering) | 0.68 |

Visual outputs include:
- Original blood cell image
- Predicted segmentation mask
- Clustered infection regions
